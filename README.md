## Features

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality of the shopping cart and other interactive elements.

## Key Concepts

- **Document Loading**: Checking if the document is fully loaded before executing scripts.
- **Element Querying**: Using class selectors to query and manipulate elements in the document.
- **Event Handling**: Adding events to elements to make the shopping cart intuitive and user-friendly.

## How It Works

By combining these techniques, the shopping cart in this project works seamlessly, providing an intuitive user experience. The JavaScript code ensures that items can be added to the cart, quantities can be adjusted, and the total price is updated dynamically.
